# Transfer Learning
A simple project about how to train a neural network with very few samples (about 300 images per class and 4 classes) 
using Transfer Learning in Keras &amp; Tensorflow.

In this project I use a pre trained Neural Network as a features extractor and them 
use those features to train a Logistic Regression model for identifying between 4 classes 
(cups, keyboards, backpack bags and bottles).

## Principal Dependencies 
* Tensorflow 2.1.0
* Keras 2.3.1
* scikit-learn 0.22.1
